Assignment 1 - Supervised Learning

Code can be accessed at this Github repository:
https://github.com/Vi2x101/CS7641-Supervised-Learning.git

Before running any code, it is advised to download any packages needed using environment.yml.

In the models folder, there are two folders: one for the Wine Quality models and the other for the Breast Cancer models. Each of those folders contain individual jupyter notebooks for each algorithm. To run the code and see results mentioned in the report, you just have to run the entirety of each of the jupyter notebooks. Data is read in through an API call to the UCI ML repository so there is no CSV file to be submitted with this assignment.
